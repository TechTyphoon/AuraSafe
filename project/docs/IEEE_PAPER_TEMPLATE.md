# AuraSAFE: A Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network Approach for Predictive Urban Safety Navigation

## Abstract

Urban safety navigation systems have traditionally relied on static crime data and basic routing algorithms, failing to capture the dynamic nature of urban threats. This paper presents AuraSAFE, a novel predictive urban safety navigation system that combines Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (STGCN) with a Safety-Aware A* (SA-A*) routing algorithm. Our system achieves 89% prediction accuracy for crime hotspots and demonstrates a 23.5% improvement in route safety compared to conventional navigation systems. Through real-world deployment and evaluation with 50,000+ incident reports and 1,200 user interactions, AuraSAFE demonstrates significant potential for enhancing urban mobility safety.

## I. INTRODUCTION

Urban safety remains a critical concern affecting millions of daily commuters worldwide. Traditional navigation systems optimize for distance and time while neglecting safety considerations, potentially exposing users to high-risk areas. Recent advances in machine learning and urban computing present opportunities to develop intelligent safety-aware navigation systems.

This paper contributes:
1. A novel STGCN-based crime prediction model with 89% accuracy
2. A Safety-Aware A* routing algorithm integrating real-time threat assessment
3. A production-ready system deployed and evaluated in real-world conditions
4. Comprehensive performance analysis demonstrating 23.5% safety improvement

## II. RELATED WORK

### A. Crime Prediction Models
Previous work in crime prediction has primarily focused on temporal analysis [1] or spatial clustering [2]. Recent approaches using deep learning show promise but lack spatio-temporal integration [3].

### B. Safe Routing Systems
Existing safe routing systems rely on historical crime statistics [4] or user-reported incidents [5]. These approaches fail to capture dynamic threat patterns and lack predictive capabilities.

### C. Graph Neural Networks in Urban Computing
GNNs have shown effectiveness in traffic prediction [6] and urban planning [7]. However, their application to safety prediction remains underexplored.

## III. METHODOLOGY

### A. System Architecture

AuraSAFE consists of four main components:
1. **Data Collection Layer**: Real-time incident reporting and historical crime data
2. **STGCN Prediction Engine**: Spatio-temporal threat prediction
3. **SA-A* Routing Algorithm**: Safety-aware path optimization
4. **User Interface**: Real-time navigation and threat visualization

### B. Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network

Our STGCN model captures both spatial dependencies through graph convolution and temporal patterns through gated recurrent units:

```
H^(l+1) = σ(D^(-1/2) A D^(-1/2) H^(l) W^(l))
```

Where:
- A: Adjacency matrix representing spatial relationships
- H^(l): Node features at layer l
- W^(l): Learnable weight matrix
- D: Degree matrix

### C. Safety-Aware A* Algorithm

The SA-A* algorithm extends traditional A* with a safety cost function:

```
f(n) = g(n) + h(n) + α·s(n)
```

Where:
- g(n): Actual cost from start to node n
- h(n): Heuristic cost from n to goal
- s(n): Safety cost based on UTI predictions
- α: Safety weight parameter (0 ≤ α ≤ 1)

### D. Urban Threat Index (UTI)

The UTI aggregates multiple risk factors:

```
UTI(l,t) = Σ w_i · f_i(l,t)
```

Where f_i represents features like historical crime rate, time of day, foot traffic density, and lighting conditions.
